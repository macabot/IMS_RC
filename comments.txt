meanShiftTracker
When tracking blue with 10 bins, then player is tracked
3bins/4bins, then half-line is tracked

tracking upperLeft, switches orange player
upperLeft2 (target only orange), then player is tracked correctly
upperleft 100 bins (RGB): weights in meanshift become 0 and tracker fails
upperleft 10 bins (RGB): meanshift works fine
upperLeft 100 bins with normalized rgb: meanshift works fine

'dreads2' (smaller target) tracks player while 'dreads' switches player
